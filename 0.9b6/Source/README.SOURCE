Kevo has been written in C and should be relatively easy to portto other machine platforms. The only part which requires majorporting is the object browser. The source is pretty well commented and should be relatively easy to understand at least to those who are familiar with threaded interpretive languages and know the basics of prototype-based object-oriented programming. If you haveany questions, send e-mail to one of the addresses below. Have fun!-- Antero Taivalsaari   tsaari@cs.uta.fi   kevo-interest@ursamajor.uvic.ca--------------------------------------------------------------------Description of Kevo's source files:The files have been divided into two categories, accordingto whether they are supposed to be portable or not. The (almost) portable files are:main.c		The main program and system initializationkernel.c	Inner interpreters and most elementary primitivesprim.c		Primitive operations global.c	Global variables and other system-wide definitionsmemory.c	Memory allocation primitivescontext.c	Object name space (vocabulary) management primitivestasks.c		Multitasking primitivesfiles.c		File input/output and redirection primitivesimage.c		Image file loading primitiveskeybuf.c	Keyboard buffer primitivessignals.c	Exception handlers (this is quite limited on Mac)debug.c		Debugging primitivesblockfiles.c Virtual memory management (Forth-style block files)lists.c		Special linear list structure for clone families etc.family.c	Clone family management primitivesrecompile.c	Early binding routines for CUT/COPY/PASTE operationsFiles that require major porting are:portEvents.c	The event loop and general Mac application frameworkportGlobal.c	Non-portable global variables and definitionsportPrim.c		Non-portable primitive operationsportWindow.c	Window management primitivesportBrowser.c	The browserportEdit.c		Browser's CUT/COPY/PASTE primitivesiconDef.c		List definition procedure (LDEF) for displaying icons 				in the browser (this is _very_ Mac-specific)--------------------------------------------------------------------Comment: When compiling the files under Think C, the followingfragment of code has to be commented out from file 'console.c' in Think C's ANSI library. Otherwise the "cancel" operation(Command-period) will often cause the Kevo system to quitwhich is not the desired behavior.		/*  check for interrupt  *//* Comment out this:	if (interrupted) {		interrupted = 0;		FlushEvents(keyDownMask, 0);		fp->cnt = 0;		raise(SIGINT);		errno = EINTR;		result = EOF;	}*/
