Mirror of Kevo 0.9b6 by Antero Taivalsaari from https://www.macintoshrepository.org/52313-kevo-0-9b6
I found this via https://www.bradrodriguez.com/papers/oofs.htm
Kevo is a prototype-based language related to forth. It uses purely concatenative inheritance, see

To summarize from this link:
**Concatenative Inheritance: The Most Commonly Used Inheritance You’ve Never Heard Of**

Because dynamic object extension is so common in JavaScript, and so fundamental to so many common JavaScript idioms, it is the most commonly used form of inheritance in JavaScript. It is not widely recognized as such because it is not what people think of when they think of the word, “inheritance”.
